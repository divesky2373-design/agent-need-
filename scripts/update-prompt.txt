Read needs.json in this repository. For each task entry in the "tasks" array:

1. Web search for the current official pricing of the "best" tool and each alternative. Check the official pricing pages directly.
2. Compare with the pricing currently in needs.json. If anything has changed, update it.
3. Check if the recommended tool's SDK/package name has changed (search npm/pypi).
4. Check if any major new tools have launched in this category that should be added as alternatives.
5. If a previously-recommended tool has been deprecated, acquired, or significantly degraded, consider changing the "best" pick.
6. Update the "last_verified" field to today's date for every entry you verify.
7. Update "last_updated" in the root of the JSON to today's date.

Also check if any new common development task categories should be added (e.g., new types of APIs or services that agents frequently need).

Rules:
- Only update fields where you find confirmed changes from official sources.
- Keep all code examples syntactically valid.
- Preserve the existing JSON structure and schema.
- Be concise in "why" fields — focus on specific numbers (speed, cost, limits).

After updating, show a summary of what changed.
